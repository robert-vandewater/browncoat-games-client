When one alliance controls 5 of the cities of Light, they win the game.


To Control a City of Light, an Alliance must first win an Orb of Light

Once the Orb has been won at auction, it will be delivered to the capital of the player that contributed the largest amount of gold to the winning bid.

There is one orb for each of the ruined cities of light.  (i.e. The Orb of Narvik is only good for the ruined city of Narvik.)


When the Orb has been taken to its city:

1.  The hex and its immediate surroundings are cleared of blight.
2.  The city is restored as the people of Shalea hoping for a better 
   life return.

The Orb can no longer be removed or stolen and the city will be there until the end of the game.


The Power of the Orbs:

Each city with an orb is automatically "Blessed by the Light of Shalea"

With 1 orb the player can designate a city that is "Blessed by the Light of Shalea".  That city will produce double and get bonuses to siege.  
 
With 2 orbs, the player can cast:

"Fair Weather" allows a fleet to move at double movement with no sea worthiness checks

With 3 orbs, the player can cast:

"Army of the Light" - potent bonuses to combat and movement speed to one army for a given duration

With 4 orb, the alliance can cast a different spell (once a week)

"Blessing of Peace" - Designate a single city in which no hostile action can take place for duration x.
