The Blighted Lands are lands destroyed by the Tarnim'Dal during the War of Light and Darkness.  They are contaminated with extra-planar magical power and the abode of creatures that escaped from other dimensions to Shalea.  They cover most of central Shalea and have the following properties:

High Resistance to ZOC
Low Movement Rate
Resource productivity greatly reduced
Possible recruitment of Tarnim'Dal
Armies in Blight undergo numerical attrition
Armies in Blight undergo attrition to morale

The Blighted Lands can be cleansed in one of two ways.

A high level mage spell can clear a blighted hex.

A Gray Council action can clear a blighted hex.  (or more than one--balance)
