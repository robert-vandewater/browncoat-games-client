The ZOC (Zone of Control) Concept is extremely important

Since ZOC is controlled by the relative power of the different players
contesting for control, it is vital to have a ZOC RATING that can be directly
compared to determine who has control of a given hex.

if ZOC RATING Player 1 > ZOC RATING Player 2 for hex abcd

hex abcd is controlled by player 1

Every location and hunkered down army has a ZOC RATING

ZOC RATING proposed formula:

For an individual army or location:

ZOC RATING = ARMY STRENGTH * FORTIFICATION FACTOR * LOCATION SIZE FACTOR * ARMY
MOVEMENT SPEED / DISTANCE FROM HEX

ARMY STRENGTH = # Troops * offensive rating * defensive rating
FORTIFICATION FACTOR = 3 for major fortifications, 2 for fortifications
LOCATION SIZE FACTOR = 3 for Major City, 2 for city , 1 for Town,
ARMY MOVEMENT SPEED = movement speed of the garrison
DISTANCE FROM HEX = Number movement points to get to hex from the location

If there is no garrison, the location is assumed to have a minimal garrison that
depends on the Location Size and Fortification level

Neutral hexes

Every hex has a CONTROL RESISTANCE based on terrain type. (Plains hexes are
easy to control, Mountain hexes are difficult)

A hex is neutral if no player has ZOC RATING > CONTROL RESISTANCE

TOTAL ZOC RATING (?)

Do we make ZOC RATING additive?

What if a player has multiple cities that have a non-zero ZOC RATING on a given
hex?

Player 1 has 3 cities "Lumbaba" and "Moriki" and "Tresadai" that exert ZOC
RATING of 300, 100 and 125. For a plains hex with CONTROL RESISTANCE = 500

Would player 1 have control of the hex? Or not?

ALLIED ZOC RATING

What do we do if an alliance has a greater CONTROL RATING than a single player
of the opposite alliance?

It is possible that Player 1 of the red alliance has ZOC RATING 550 over a
plains hex while Player 7 + Player 9 of the blue alliance exert 300 and 400 on
that same hex. What happens in this case?

If a plains hex have a CONTROL RESISTANCE of 500, Player 7 and Player 9 do not
have enough to control the hex.

Player 1 has enough to control the hex, but Player 7 and 9 are stronger than he
is in that hex.

If the red alliance ZOC RATING is < the blue alliance ZOC RATING but a red
alliance player has the highest player ZOC, then that hex is considered to be
part of the blue alliance ZOC.

A hex in the blue alliance ZOC does not add to any blue players economy, but is
in the alliance ZOC for purposes of movement only.
