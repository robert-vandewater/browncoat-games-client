Army Combat


Each Army WILL have a STANCE (Win at all costs/Determined/Skittish/Evade/Harry)

If both of the armies are in "harry" or "evade" mode, then no combat will take place.

If one of the armies is in "Harry" mode, then they avoid combat as long as their movementrate > enemy movement rate * 1.4

If one of the armies is in "Evade" mode, then they avoid combat as long as their movement > enemy movement rate * 1.2

Each Army MAY have characters 

A RANDOM FACTOR will be determined once for the battle.  This factor is applied to the lethality of each round and could have a large cumulative effect.

Each Army WILL have all its troops in 1 of 10 slots:

1 Cavalry Slot

3 Reserve Slots (Strongest, 2nd Strongest, weakest)

3 Front Slots (1/2/3)

**** NOTE ****	
	The FRONT slots used to be divided into left/right/center BUT this leads to some confusion.  In combat between Army A and Army B, the Front Left Slot 
	of Army A would fight the Front Right slot of Army B.  This is confusing.  Call them slots 1, 2, 3 and say that A1 fights B1.


3 Support Slots (1/2/3)

When armies first engage the following sequence of events occurs:

The Support Slots open fire on the Front Slots of the opposing side and casualties are calculated.

The Cavalry Slots engage

The corresponding Front slots engage (left v right/ center v center)

For each engaged slot:
	1.  The overall strength of the slot is calculated.
	
	Overall Strength = function( terrain, weapon quality, terrain, troop training, troop number, applicable spells, applicable items)
	
	2.  The comparative strengths are used to select a CASUALTY PROFILE
	
	CASUALTY PROFILE (% Killed, % Wounded, % Deserted)
	      Overun > 20: 1
		  20 : 1
		  15 : 1
		  10 : 1
		  5  : 1
		  4  : 1
		  3  : 1
		  2  : 1
		  1  : 1
          1  : 2
		  1  : 3
		  1  : 4
		  1  : 5
		  1  : 10
		  1  : 15
		  1  : 20
		  Overun < 20 : 1

    ** Note that lopsided casualty profiles typically have moderate increases in killed / wounded percentages but large differences in desertion percentage
	** Note A random factor 
		  
		  
	3.  The casualty profile is modified by the appropriate modifiers (spells, training level difference, weapon quality difference)
	
	These modifications are calculated as follows:
	
	Slot 1 of Army A has had Casualty profile 1:1 inflicted upon it.  This is (for example) .02k, .04w, .06d
	There are 3 different types of troops in Slot 1 of Army A
	
	100 Type A training level 3 armor 3 weapons 3
	100 Type B training level 2 armor 2 weapons 2
	100 Type C training level 1 armor 1 weapons 1
	
	There are 3 different types of troops in Slot 1 of Army B
	
	100 Type D training level 1 armor 2 weapons 2
	100 TYPE E training level 2 armor 3 weapons 3
	100 TYPE F training level 3 armor 1 weapons 1
	
	each slot in army 1 (A,B,C) suffers .02k, .04w, .06d
	
	these values are modified as follows:
	
	% TYPE D = % of OVERALL SLOT STRENGTH contributed by TYPE D
	% TYPE E = % of OVERALL SLOT STRENGTH contributed by TYPE E	
	% TYPE F = % of OVERALL SLOT STRENGTH contributed by TYPE F	
	
	TYPE A troops suffer .02 Killed, .04 wounded and .06 deserted with the following modifiers
	
	killed = .02 * % TYPE D (TLD_AD + AWD_AD) + 
	         .02 * % TYPE E (TLD_AE + AWD_AE) + 
			 .02 * % TYPE F (TLD_AF + AWD_AF)
	where TLD_AD is the Training level difference modifier to KILLED between A and D
	      AWD_AD is the Armor/Weapon difference modifier to KILLED between A and E 
		  and so on
  
	killed and wounded is modified by training level difference / offensive quality difference / slot penetration flanking bonuses
	
	deserted is modified by army morale / spells / commander level / training level (not level difference) / defensive quality difference / offensive quality difference 	
	
	SLOT OVERRUN
	
	When a slot is overrun, it endures the OVERRUN slot casualty profile and inflicts the inverse profile on the enemy.  
	The slot is then disolved and the remaining troops are added to the next opponent slot of the slot that defeated them.
	(This avoids a huge discontinuity in casualties between overrun slots and those that are not overrun.  Such a discontinuity
	may be "REALISTIC" but one goal of the combat system is to avoid the JUGGERNAUT phenomena where the most effective strategy
	is creating a single gigantic army.)
	
	SLOT COLLAPSE
	
	When the total number of casualties exceeds the casualty threshold determined by the ARMY STANCE, the slot has collapsed.
	The morale of the army is penalized, the slots casualties are rounded off and applied to the troops in the slot.
	
	SLOT REPLACEMENT
	
	For Front Slot 1 of an army, the order of combat is:
	
	enemy Front Slot 1,
	enemy Reserve Slot 1 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Reserve Slot 2 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Reserve Slot 3 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 1 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Front   Slot 2 (with 50% flanking bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 2 (with 50% flanking bonus)
	enemy Front Slot   3 (with 50% flanking bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 3 (with 50% flanking bonus)
	enemy Cavarly Slot   (no bonus)
	
	For the Cavalry Slot
	enemy Cavalry Slot
	enemy Reserve Slot 1 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Reserve Slot 2 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Reserve Slot 3 (with 10% penetration bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 1 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 2 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Support Slot 3 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Front   Slot 1 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Front   Slot 2 (with 25% penetration bonus)
	enemy Front   Slot 3 (with 25% penetration bonus)
		
	Note that the PENTRATION BONUSES are LETHALITY bonuses that modify the CASUALTY PROFILE and not OVERALL STREGTH bonuses.
	Note also that commanders skill will effect the penetration bonus as follows:
	
		[ + (Penetrating Slot's Commander Rating / 2)  - (defending slot Commander Rating / 3) ] / BALANCE FACTOR
	
	Note that the defender's commander rating is not as significant as the offensive commander's rating.
	 
	ARMY DEFEAT
		
	When all of the slots of a given army have been defeated the army has been defeated.
	
	Defeated armies incur a morale penalty depending on their stance
	Defeated armies will return to their sponsoring city 
	All troops in the army with a slower movement rate than the victorious army will abandon their equipment.
	(This abandoned equipment suffers a smaller loss percentage than the spoils gained through killing)
	
	Victorious Army 
	Gets spoils depending on the number of troops killed and their equipment (Minus a hefty loss factor)
	Gain a small morale increase.
	Gain experience and possible level.
